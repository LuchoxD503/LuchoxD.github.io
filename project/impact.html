<h2>Vulnerable Society</h2>
<p>Since Global Warming has been a debated topic, people around the world are seeing the drawbacks of it.
The impacts that global warming brings to society are hurtful mainly because population has increased so much.
<strong>Pollution</strong> from cars emanating carbon dioxide increases respiratory diseases as well as temparatures. If we continue
to ignore global warming, <em>disastrous events</em> could occur such violent weather, extreme drought, and flooding.</p>

<h2>Shortage of Foods</h2>
<p>The most vulnerable group from global warming is <em>farmers</em>. Farmers cultivate different kind of vegetables as well as fruits
on certain time of the year. If temperature increases every year, farmers would not able to grow these foods because too much
heat burn their plantations.If people do not control gases that go into the earth's atmosphere, there would be food <strong>shortage.</strong>
In addition, farmers wouldn't be able to sustain their income, and their profession would be worthless.</p>
