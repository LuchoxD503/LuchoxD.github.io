<h2>What is Global Warming</h2>
<p> Global Warming is a <strong>gradual increase</strong> in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect. In addition, the greenhouse
is catalogued or caused by the increased quatities of gases. Furthermore, the increases of gases is derived from the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) that cars exhale as they burn fuel.
Besides, these gases trap the heat from the sun, and they are stuck on the earth's atmosphere. The result from the gases being on the atmosphere is an increase temperature on the earth.</p>

<h2> Origins of Global Warming</h2>
<p>Evidence of global warming started to show up when scientists started to measure <em>Carbon Dioxide (CO2)</em> readings in the late 1950s. They basically measure the readings by producing
concentration curves graphically. In addition, the scientists recorded the data and comparing them. As years progressed, technology continue to evolve and offer scientists better and advanced tools
to record data more efficiently. Lastly, they compared the data from decades, and they noticed an increased temperature ratio.</p>

<h2> Effects of Global Warming</h2>
<p>The following introduces the changes that Earth Planet is having caused by the <strong>greenhouse effect.</strong> As mentioned before gases, which is mostly Carbon Dioxide, trap the heat, and makes the planet hotter than it should be.
 These effects can be seen around the world, but it varies dependning the environment for humans as well as animals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temparature Increase</li>
<li>Extreme Weather Events</li>
<li>Ice Melt</li>
</ol>
