<h2> Increase of Sea Levels</h2>
<p> <strong>Global warming</strong> that is affecting today's society is very notorious. For example, people that live close
to Italy's coastline are seeing the sea level <em>increases as year progress.</em> This means that probably another 25 years
coastline cities would be under water if people do not something about global warming. Not only Italy's coastlines are seeing this 
problem, other coastline countries are having this issue.</p>

<h2>Increase Temperature Around The World</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, temperature increases every year depending how much gases are trap on the Earth's atmosphere as well as 
the ratio. As for example, <strong>The Sahara Desert</strong> reaches hot temperatures that the <em>ecosystem</em> of animals that live there are being threatened.
For instance, animals get out of their hideo outs to hunt during dawn or nightime. In addition, herbivores that can only eat vegetation would 
go extinct because vegetation would not be available for them in a long term if global warming is deal properly.</p>

<h2>Other Issues</h2>
<p>There are other problems that would be notable on the longterm future if global warming is not deal properly.
Some of these issues are noticeable such as hotter summers; however, they would get worse. Here are some of the other problems
that people could face on the longterm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heavy Downpours</li>
<li>Ocean Acidification</li>
<li>Impacts on Energy</li>
</ol>

<h2>Helpful Information</h2>
<p>Since organizations and governments are aware of global warming, they are taking action in order to minimize the impact on the 
longterm future. If the measures provided by these entities help, they could strategize for more effective ways for  good future for the planet.
